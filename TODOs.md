# TODOs
- add a "login" screen where you can not pass until you have entered your pubkey.
    - then I can lockdown the other endpoints to require that the user is "logged in" and the pubkey is in the server?
- add better logging everywhere
- create a fee market in the ngiri mempool somehow
- add a pyproject.toml to manage ruff line length stuff so that ruff formatting is inline with the lsp?
- do async await getting the current memepool fee rates?
