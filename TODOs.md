# TODOs
- add better logging everywhere
- create a fee market in the ngiri mempool somehow
- add a pyproject.toml to manage ruff line length stuff so that ruff formatting is inline with the lsp?
- do async await getting the current memepool fee rates?

Notes
- all the esplora endpoint are locally at localhost:3000
