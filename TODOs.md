# TODOs
- refactor some of the wallet service test setup stuff, that is a bit redundent
- make /fee endpoint take in query params and url params
- want to be able to add multiple utxos in a tx and get the fee it will cost.
- add a pyproject.toml to manage ruff line length stuff so that ruff formatting is inline with the lsp?
- do async await getting the current memepool fee rates.
