# TODOs
- want to be able to add multiple utxos in a tx and get the fee it will cost.
    - I refactored this in the backend and added tests, but make changes in the frontend to make sure it works.
- add a pyproject.toml to manage ruff line length stuff so that ruff formatting is inline with the lsp?
- do async await getting the current memepool fee rates.
